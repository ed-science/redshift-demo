This may be a huge issue for some, but I don\u2019t ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul.

I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating.

It was in my pocket and I was not ready, but got it out, sparked it and pitty the pit bull backed off. Of course the owner also called it off, so not really a good test, but dog did look a little perturbed when it was noisily sparking.

They do fade quickly but we we do keep them on the boat and sun kits them. I have to be re sewing them several times. But think now have to pitch they are torn & threaded and beyond repair. And as others say line inner tube Line up before adding air. If I get a years out of 2 I\u2019m happy. Also I hate plastic and fabric cover is so much nicer. To the Company please do more stitching and maybe heavier material closer sewn & if the bottom material was little thicker it last longer. I do like just up grade. We will pay extra for quality to last longer. Going to have to sew my new 2 , Sadly already May just been flaws idk. But those are disappointing.

Overall, I really like this case/sleeve. I do not have a Macbook so I tried it with two different sized computers and they both fit so there is plenty of room. The zipper opens on three sides which allows the case to open completely and lay flat on the table. The inside is cushioned and provides protection for the device. I do love the color though it looks closer to royal than navy blue. One downside for me is that there is no handle or strap with which to carry the case. The case would easily fit inside a backpack or briefcase but would be a bit more cumbersome to carry alone. In addition, the case is a fairly slick material so it can slip out of your hand while carrying. It is waterproof (I tested it by putting a sheet of paper inside and holding it out in the rain; the paper remained dry) and has a roomy zippered pocket on the outside for carrying a mouse or ear buds or other items. Overall, I like this product. I won't get a chance to use it, however, as my son immediately took it for his school computer- a perfect fit.", "review_title": "Perfect Fit", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}
