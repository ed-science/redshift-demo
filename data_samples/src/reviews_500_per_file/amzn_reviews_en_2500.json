You could feel the heat, the exhaustion, the sting of knives and bullets, the terror of the unknown in the darkness. Loved the premise, although how a company bought land and got government permits to set up drilling operations practically overnight really stretched credibility. Without giving anything away, some of the story was too predictable. (Gee, why is all that platinum buried three miles down?) I also would have preferred if the story had been told from the perspective of one character, whether hero or anti-hero, but that never really happened. Even the author could not seem to decide if he liked or hated certain key characters. The most heroic had only minor supporting roles and some of them did not fare well.

The material is durable and the lips around the edges allow them to collect dirt and debris. The only flaw I found was the texture on the trunk mat. I was hoping for something that had a little more friction. As is, my groceries slide all over the place on the slick surface. This would be a good thing if you have something heavy, say a big tent, cooler full of ice and drinks, and large luggage that you want to set on the edge and slide to the back of the vehicle. In that case, you don't want sticky friction making it more difficult. That is a rare case for me, as I am more likely to throw a cart full of groceries back there. That type of texture would have made it difficult to clean too, which I can appreciate. I like the texture on the rest of the floor mats where it makes sense. It is enough of a problem for me that I removed a star. I also removed a star because they are extremely expensive! I would have liked to see them more around $150 - $175. But I still bought them, and I do HOPE they last for the life of the vehicle, in which case, it is a worthy investment. If I have to replace them in 5 years, the cost would then be unreasonable. Overall, I highly recommend these floor mats to anyone looking to protect their 2016 RAV4 floors. They are very expensive and things in the trunk do slide around too much, but you won't find a better fit or better protection I think. 3/5 stars.

I'd have rather paid a little more to get a couple minor improvements and then the difference between these and $180 bibs would have been far less and this would be a 5 star review. So where's the area for improvements: 1) In this price range a gel chamois is expected or at least something approximating that sort of density. Sadly I didn't see that in the description it says \"foam\" padding. That's just lame. It really doesn't do much of anything padding wise. 2) While I'm sure it helps from a coolness factor, the bib straps are just too flimsy a material. It isn't the same as the rest of the shorts so it really doesn't pull the shorts up and keep them in position. Better than a drawstring at the waist but just not as functional as a bib should be. If you want bibs that would be great for relatively short rides (padding not so important) in hot weather, these would be ok, but they really aren't up there for more substantial rides.", "review_title": "Verdict is still out...", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}
