It\u2019s pretty small but does the job of favors. I put epsom bath salts in them. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend these for my favors only because they\u2019re on the smaller side. The amount of bath salt I could place in them isn\u2019t enough for my guests to actually be able to use. I read multiple reviews about pieces being broken and corks being difficult and they\u2019re all true. I originally ordered two packages. Two in each package were broken. I ordered another two, and again, about two pieces were broken in each package. The corks don\u2019t stay in, you do have to push them in pretty far in order to stay, HOWEVER, doing so, you won\u2019t be able to remove them anymore. I tried to remove one and the cork ended up breaking into pieces. The glasses are EXTREMELY fragile. I dropped one that was broken at the top, into the trash and it shattered into a million pieces. Definitely putting a sign in front of these for the baby shower that says fragile. Also, needed to buy little baggies to put them in, that way if they do break during the baby shower, it\u2019s within each baggy. They\u2019re very cute, and does the job, but it\u2019s a safety concern, the corks either fall out or don\u2019t come out at all, and they\u2019re pretty small.", "review_title": "It\u2019s pretty small but does the job of favors", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}
